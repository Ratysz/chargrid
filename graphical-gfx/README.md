# prototty\_graphical\_gfx

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/prototty_graphical_gfx.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/prototty_graphical_gfx)
[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/prototty_graphical_gfx/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/prototty_graphical_gfx)

A graphical frontend for prototty which renders with opengl via gfx.
This is kept around until wgpu-based prototty\_graphical crate becomes more stable (at least until it starts depending
on a released version of wgpu).
